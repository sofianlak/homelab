üè† Homelab

The purpose of my homelab is to be the playground for learning and experimentation. If I had to sum up it in one word : **Tinkerer**.

Most of my self-hosted applications run on Kubernetes. First, because I love the platform and second because it makes me feel responsible for the entire process of deploying and maintaining an application from A to Z. 

It pushes me to think critically about system design, backup strategies, security, scalability, and the overall ease of deployment and maintenance.
